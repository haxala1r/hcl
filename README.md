# haxala1r's Cryptography Library
This is a project aiming to provide secure implementations for cryptographic
(and non-cryptographic) hash functions, encryption algorithms, PRNGs and more.

Despite the name, this library also aims to provide non-cryptographic algorithms
as well.

Currently provided hash algorithms:

- Murmur3 32-bit
- Jenkin's one at a time
- MD5
- SHA-1

Tests must also be added for each algorithm added.

I do accept all kinds of contributions. If you see an error, vulnerability and
the like, feel absolutely free to open an issue.
